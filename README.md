# AryMem - Memory Manipulation Library

AryMem is a .NET library designed to simplify the process of reading and writing to process memory in Windows environments. It provides easy-to-use methods for interacting with the memory of other processes which can be utilized in developing game hacks, custom debuggers, or tools for software testing.

## Features

- Read and write various types of data to process memory, including primitive types, strings, and arrays of bytes.
- Retrieve process module information such as base address and memory size by name.
- Calculate pointers by offsets, making multi-level pointer dereferencing straightforward.
- Perform pattern scans within the target process's memory space to find signatures.
- Simple function for replacing assembly instructions with NOP (no operation) within the target process.
